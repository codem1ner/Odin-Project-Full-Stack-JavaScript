# Introduction

Intermediate HTML and CSS Course



## Introduction

This is the first of the two part course where we dig deeper into HTML and CSS.

- There are many more HTML elements than what we've done previously
- Important elements such as forms and tables
- CSS: variables, functions, shadows and grid layouts
- By the time you finish this course, you’ll be able to recreate just about any web design you can find on the internet… which is an important skill to carry forward. 
- Learn about animations, accessibility, and responsive design 



## Assignment

1. [HTML Elements Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) 
   - No need to commit this to memory because you’ll be learning the important parts as we go
2. [CSS Cheat Sheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/)
   - Just use it to get a feel for what you still have left to learn!
